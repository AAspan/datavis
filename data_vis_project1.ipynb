    "- The goal of this project is to help you get familiar with basic data processing using Python and Pandas. This project does not involve data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You must use Python and Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an individual project. Each student must submit his/her own work. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The three data files used in this project are included in a separate Zip file. All the data files are from [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources). Upload these data files to your Colab working directory or the Jupyter Notebook working directory. If you are not sure where your Jupyter working directory is, please read my Notes on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best way to do this project is to open this file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, enter your code in the blank cell under each question, and run it. People coming from Java, JavaScript, or C++ background need to get used to Jupyter Notebook where source code cells are interleaved with text cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit two things: a text file that contains the link to your Ipynb file in Google Colab (or the Ipynb file itself if you don't use Google Colab) and a PDF printout of your Ipynb file. **Make sure your Ipynb file in Google Colab is shared so that anyone with the link can view.** Do not put this link in public.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each of your submitted files should include both source code and output. This will make it easier for my TA and I to check your answers. **Do not submit only the source code without output or the output without the source code.** <br> You can put the two files in a Zip file and submit the Zip file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not submit by email. "
